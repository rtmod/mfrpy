    "## Motivation\n",
    "Conventional shortest-path algorithms are extremely refined and efficient. However, they are not necessarily applicable to the modeling of all types of networks. Cell signal transduction networks constitute one such example. In these instances, connections between subcomponents can be represented as directed edges, but there is no standardized representation for certain relationships between components, specifically those of conditional dependence of some components on others (synergy) and the inhibitory actions of components on the network. Taking these notions into account, our interest shifts from finding the shortest path from a source node to a target node to obtaining a collection of *minimal functional routes* by which a signal can travel from source to target, given the relationships between vertices in the network. One of the core aims of this project is capturing these important relationships graphically in order to better represent these important systems. We draw heavily from ideas presented by Reka Albert and colleagues at the University of Kansas, who have layed much of the theoretical groundwork for these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synergy\n",
    "A regular connection between two components of a signal transduction network can be represented by a directed edge between two nodes on the graph of the network. But how can we capture the fact that some components are only activated when two (or more) of its predecessors are activated in tandem? This is where the concept of synergy comes in. When the activation of a component is conditionally dependent on the simultaneous activation of several other components, the component's corresponding node on the graph is said to have a synergistic set of predeccessors consisting of precisely the nodes of the conditional components. Alternatively, we can say that the edges between these nodes have the same synergy value, which is the method by which this charecteristic is employed in the actual algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Inhibition\n",
    "It is often the case in practical cell transduction networks that one component inhibits the activation of another. This too, can be captured graphically. A certain node can be inhibited by one of its predeccessors, so instead of drawing an activating edge between them we might want to consider calling the edge between them inhibitory. More generally, we can map every edge of the graph to the binary group, so that every edge mapped to 1 is considered inhibitory and all others are normall activating edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Work\n",
    "How do we represent attributes such as synergy and inhibition graphically? One way we may try is by adding new conventions, such as dashed and barred edges, but this is largely unintuitive and can lead to ambiguity and confusion. Instead, we can transform the entire graph with the appropriate attributes into an \"expanded\" version of itself - a directed graph with only activating edges but with no ambiguity as to what components are synergistic and which are inhibitory. This is done by introducing new vertices: composite and inhibitory nodes. Composite nodes link a conditionally dependent node to its synergistic set of predecessors, while inhibitory nodes are activated when one component inhibits another. For example, if A inhibits B, we can also say that NOT A activates B AND A activates NOT B. By employing these tricks we can circumvent possible confusion and create programs which are capable of working with these notions.\n"

    "This is a method for calculating the minimal functional routes of an expanded graph provided by **update_expand**. The method uses a top-down subgraph-growing algorithm to generate minimal functional routes in the expanded graph. starting from a target node, the algorithm examines its predecessors. If there are no composite nodes, it proceeds by adding predecessors one at a time until it reaches the source node, at which point it will pursue a different chain of predecessors, much like a normal shortest-path algorithm. However, if it encounters a composite node, the method appends all of the nodes predecessors as one synergistic set in the minimal functional route. To avoid redundancy that may occur from cyclic graphs, cycles are cleaved after all minimal functional routes are generated."
